# Notes on compression methods (DEFLATE) & SQL & Protobuf mismatch

1. Stateless Pods leads to big DB entry

- Question: How to reduce size of each entry
- Answer: Compress data - GZIP!
  How it works: <br/>
  DEFLATE algorithm = LZ77 + Huffman coding <br/>
  LZ77 - finds repeated occurences with a reference composed of: the jump(distance from the reference)
  and the length of the occurence. <br/>
  e.g. this is repeated this way. <br/>
  this is repeated <17, 5>, where 17: distance, 5: length of target <br/>
  Huffman coding - Btree with most frequently used as 0 encoding <br/>
  => Compression

2. SQL

- Question // TODO

3. Protobuf with different package name
   Even if the protobuf definitions are the same, if the package name is different,
   client and server will not be able to match with each other, resulting in connection error.
