# Where we are now + thoughts on giving up on a good opportunity

With two breakthrough technologies AI & Blockchain being integrated into the wheels of society, is it necessary for us to
keep on adding to what we have? <br/>
Greed is good. Greed plays a huge role in driving the society to move forward. But maybe it's time to look at what we've missed out
due to greed playing the major role in abundant society that we live in. Bill Gates repetitively spoke out on how ill-prepared all
of us are to a pandemic 4 years ago. Where we stand now is nothing but a minor validation to all members of the society to be more alert.
Every associates of the academia are repetitively emphasizing the future of humanity due to climate change. Due to greed, we have overlooked
the debt that has been accumulating since the industrial revolution. <br/>
As a mere employee working on a tech driven firm, I've experienced "technical debt" first hand. Building features on top of features that
were supposedly at the level of <i>Proof of Concept</i> would come to stagnated development and unknown bugs appearing more and more frequently.
It is only a mere luck that I proposed to halt on all new development and enter the refactoring stage at the right moment. Hence began
the development of Go-based systems at the current company that I work at. <br/>
<br/>
I was at a path to decide on my future and the future of the company 44 miniutes ago. I had been fortunate enough to be offered a generous
offer to boost my career at a different company in a different industry. With experienced mentors, generous amount of benefits and a
genuinely sympathetic people <i>sincerely wanting</i> to work with me, I was ready to accept the offer until last night, until
I found out how devoted the people at my current workplace are and how much each individual members mattered to the company. I am by no
means the best or qualified to be in a position that i've been given. However, this company is composed of those who are willing, willing to
give up many aspects of their lives to make the idea work. Everyone knows that they are getting heavily underpaid and could enter the job market
with incomparable benefits. Furthermore, the longer one decides to stay here, the more a third person will fixate this underpaid salary to
what one is worth. <br/>
<br/>
I sincerely hope that this decision will not result in regrets and everyone on the team can keep the initial goal that we all aimed for when
starting this company until a fruitful result.
