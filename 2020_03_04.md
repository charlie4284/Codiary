  Floating MOSFET has two isolation layers wrapping an additional "floating gate". Isolation layers(ONO, Tunnel Oxide) electrically isolates
  the floating gate, letting it store electrons even without power. <br/>
  => NAND Flash Cell

  Charges applied to Control gate over a treshold voltage lets electrons overcome the isolation layer and move into the floating gate = charged => programmed as 1 <br/>
  Negative voltage applied to source & high voltage across source & train takes electrons from the floating gate => programmed as 0 <br/>

- Question:Reading values from NAND flash cells
- Answer:<br/>
  Reference voltage applied across source & drain. Current is measured. Current depends on whether the floating gate contains charge or not => readability

- Question: Amount of binary in each cell
- Answer: Granularity of voltage threshold allows more binary info

- Question: Life span
- Answer: Every Write operation reduces the electron retainability of the floating gate => reduced life span
