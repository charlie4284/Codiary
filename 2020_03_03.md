# Notes on Kubenertes system

1. Stateless, memoryless(?) pods

- Question: Why should I not design a message queue as a master worker to be able to process a lot of data efficiently?
- Answer: <br/>
  In kubernetes system, it is better to have a memory-less design of the application. It is better to have a pod fail and have the
  requests redirected to a healthy pod rather than have a fast processing module that, if fails, will take all the "stateful" data
  along with it. This is why in-memory applications like redis is better un-used at the cost of having multiple pods that do the
  same job.

2. Elementary OS

- Question: Why are my env-variables not getting set(.profile)?
- Answer: <br/>
  Elementary OS uses .bashrc. If .bashrc is not present, it will look for .profile to initialize the terminal.

3. Swapping SDD

- Question: What file system to use when creating a shared-partition between Ubuntu & Windows?
- Answer:<br/>
  Use NTFS which is readable both by windows and ubuntu. EXT4 cannot be read by windows. Be sure to make that partition untouched by windows encryption.
  Windows have a default protection over it's partitions and may try to bitlock the data which will make ubuntu unable to access the partition
