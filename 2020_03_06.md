# Notes taken while OT

1. aws-sdk-go w/ Docker

- Question: Credentials does not load in docker container even when given. Error: No valid providers in chain. Deprecated.
- Trials: giving credentials with -e flag while running docker
- mounting local .aws/credentials to docker container using: <br/>
  docker run -p 8080:8080 -v \$HOME/.aws/credentials:/home/.aws/credentials:ro data-source

2. Stupid debugging

- Binding request (context) to struct, 19.0 will not be able to bind to int type field.
